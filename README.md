# Integrated Exercise for Microprocessors Study in Telecommunications Engineering

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the academic exercise for Microprocessors in the Telecommunications and Electronics program as described in the article "Ejercicio integrador para el estudio de microprocesadores del ingeniero en telecomunicaciones y electrónica" (https://educacioneningenieria.org/index.php/edi/article/view/772). The proposal involves designing a modem using the 8051 microcontroller and simulating character transmission. It includes a clear horizontal and vertical integration with skills and knowledge from disciplines such as Telecommunications Systems, Information Theory, and Electronic Systems, which are essential in the training of professionals in Telecommunications and Electronic Engineering. MATLAB/Simulink and ISIS Proteus platforms are used for the design but the main code was programmed in C language. 

## Technologies Used
- 8051 Microcontroller
- C programming language
- MATLAB
- ISIS Proteus Platform

## Implementation
The code in this repository corresponds to the Transmiter and Reciever for the 8051 in C language.

## Setup and Running
Instructions on how to set up and run the project are especified on the original article.

## Acknowledgments
